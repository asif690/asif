Java Language Keywords
Here is a list of keywords in the Java programming language.

You cannot use any of the following as identifiers in your programs.

The keywords const and goto are reserved, even though they are not currently used. true, false, and null might seem like keywords,

but they are actually literals; you cannot use them as identifiers in your programs.


abstract	continue	for	new	switch
assert***	default	goto*	package	synchronized
boolean	do	if	private	this
break	double	implements	protected	throw
byte	else	import	public	throws
case	enum****	instanceof	return	transient
catch	extends	int	short	try

HW : try increment/decrement operators in java :





1) primitive Data types

boolean - Boolean
char - Character
byte - BYTE
short - Short
int - Integer
long - Long
float - Float
double - Double






2) non-primitive data types

class
interfaces
Arrays



Java has 3 types of variables :

1) Local variable - done
2) instant variable
3) static variable


Type Casting in Java

1) Implicit Casting
2) Explicitly casting



byte ---> short, int, long, float, double
short --- > int, long, float, double
int --> long, float, double
long --> float, double
float --> double

=============================

1) Incremental operators (++)  (Post/Pre)
2) Decremental operators (--) (Post/Pre)

// these operators are used for increasing or decreasing the value by 1.

// When you use pre-inc it adds the value before assigning it to a new variable.
